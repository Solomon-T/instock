## Overview

InStock is a web application that lets users determine whether their local stores have certain items in stock. The problem InStock seeks to address is that many small stores do not have sophisticated POI systems that allow customers to see their stock remotely. Instead, customers must physically visit the store to see if what they want is in stock. 

InStock remedies this problem by crowdsourcing data: if a certain number of users submit reports that a given store has an item in stock, a badge will appear on top of that store's location on a map visible to all users. While this isn't a 100% guarantee that a store has the item, it's a pretty good indicator.

## Technologies

InStock is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). Frontend state is handled with Redux. Maps are handled with the Google Maps Javascript API.

## To-dos

* Report Verification - users should be able to give an existing report a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" to indicate whether it's accurate.
* Verified Users - a representative/owner of a particular store should be able to become a verified user whose confirmation of a particular report is weighted higher than the average user's.
